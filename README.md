# Balloon-Math

I created this game because I wanted kids to have something more productive to play.

This game aims to help kids become better at basic addition, while at the same time allowing them to have fun.

How to play:

You will be prompted with a simple addition problem.
Two clouds with possible answers will appear.
Choose the correct answer to gain a point!
Choose the wrong answer and your score is reset back to 0
